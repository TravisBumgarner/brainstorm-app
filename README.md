# About

This is a brainstorming iOS and Android App. It's minimalistic, just the way I want it to be. 

I develop on Mac/iPhone so no comments on any other variation of computer/phone os.

# Local Development Notes

## Prettier / eslint

I am writing this as a note to myself when Prettier / eslint eventually stop working. 
All settings should be in `settings.json`. 
The installed VS Code extensions are 
- Enabled
  - Related - `ESLint`
  - Unrelated - `Black Formatter`, `Flake 8`
- Disabled
  - Related - `Prettier - Code formatter`, `Prettier ESLint` (It appears I don't need either of these plugins to lint with the NPM packages I've installed. )
